# GhostRunner

GhostRunner is a post-exploitation tool designed to demonstrate advanced process injection techniques. It allows security researchers and red teamers to experiment with different methods of code injection against live processes in controlled environments.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** GhostRunner is for **educational and research purposes only**. Use it only in lab environments or systems you are explicitly authorized to test. Misuse may violate laws and result in severe consequences.

## ‚ú® Features

- **DLL Injection** ‚Äì Load custom DLLs into a remote process.
- **Shellcode Injection** ‚Äì Inject and execute raw shellcode.
- **APC Injection** ‚Äì Queue shellcode execution in target process threads.
- **Process Hollowing** ‚Äì Replace the code of a legitimate process with a malicious payload.

## üöÄ Techniques & Usage

### üîπ DLL Injection
Injects a DLL into the specified process using the LoadLibrary technique.

```
ghostrunner.exe dll <PID> <DLL_PATH>
```
### üîπ Shellcode Injection
Injects raw shellcode into the specified process and executes it.
```
ghostrunner.exe shellcode <PID> <SHELLCODE_PATH>
```
### üîπ APC Injection
Uses Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC) to inject shellcode into threads of the target process.
```
ghostrunner.exe apc <PID> <SHELLCODE_PATH>
```
### üîπ Process Hollowing
Launches a legitimate process in a suspended state, replaces its memory with a malicious executable, and resumes execution.
```
ghostrunner.exe hollow <TARGET_EXE> <PAYLOAD_EXE>
```
